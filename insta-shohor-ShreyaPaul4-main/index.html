            What does Event Loop do in Javascript?
        </h1>
        <p class="answer">
            The event loop is the key of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. JS performs all actions on a single
            thread, but by employing a few clever data structures, it creates the illusion of multi-threading. Let's
            have a peek at what happens behind the scenes.The call stack is in charge of keeping track of all the
            operations that are waiting to be executed. When a function is completed, it is removed from the stack.The
            event queue is in charge of dispatching new functions to the stack for execution. It uses the queue data
            structure to keep track of the order in which all operations should be delivered for execution.When an async
            function is invoked, it is routed to a browser API. These are APIs that have been incorporated into the
            browser. The API begins its own single-threaded activity based on the command received from the call stack.
            The setTimeout method is an example of this. When a setTimeout action is executed in the stack, it is routed
            to the associated API, which waits until the specified time has passed before returning this operation to
            the stack for processing.

            Differeences Between Local Storage and Session Storage?
        </h1>
        <p class="answer">
            Local Storage: This read-only interface attribute gives you access to the Document's local storage object,
            where you can save data that will be accessible across browser sessions. LocalStorage data is cleared when
            the page session ends – that is, when the page is closed – in the same way that sessionStorage data is
            erased. When a browser's last "private" tab is closed, it is cleared (localStorage data for a document
            loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).DOMStrings are data storage formats that encode data
            using UTF-16, which takes two bytes per character. Strings, like objects, are produced automatically from
            integer keys. The data in LocalStorage is particular to a protocol described in the paper. This behavior
            cannot be assured since, as previously stated, the file: URL requirements are yet unknown. As a result,
            browsers may modify their file-handling behavior at any time. Some browsers' handling of it has developed.
            <br>
            Session Storage: This objects may be accessed via the read-only sessionStorage property. LocalStorage data
            does not expire, but sessionStorage data is removed when the page session expires.When a document is loaded
            into a browser tab, a new page session is generated. A page session is only valid for one tab at a time.
            Pages are only preserved for as long as the tab or browser is active; they do not remain when the page
            reloads and restores. Each time a tab or window is opened, a new session is established; this is not the
            same as session cookies. Each tab/window with the same URL opens its own sessionStorage. When you duplicate
            a tab, the original tab's sessionStorage is transferred to the replicated tab. Closing a window/tab
            terminates the session and removes any sessionStorage objects.
